<div style="text-align: justify"> I tried to predict pleural effusion on MRI scans. 
This is an image segmentation problem. Project includes preprocessing data in special format used in medicine,  
training U-net for segmentation, tracking with Tensorboard. For quality measurements DICE metric was used.
